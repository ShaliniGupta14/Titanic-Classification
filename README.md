# Titanic-Classification
In this project I have used a Logistic Regression Model to determine the survival chances of the Titanic passengers. I've considered the following values for determination.

* Pclass
* Sex
* Age
* SibSp
* Parch
* Embarked

I have acquired data from kaggle. You can download the dataset from <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>. After collecting data, I've used multiple methods to clean the data and manipulated to make it ready-for-use. I've removed null values from the dataset, as it might result in faulty predictions. Once the data was ready to be used, I have used seaborn library to visulaze various columns and their relations with other ones. 

For example : 

1 . relation between Pclass and Survived columns 

2 . relation between Sex and Survived columns
